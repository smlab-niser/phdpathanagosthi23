        <!-- <p>PhD Pathana Gosthi, hosted by the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) in Odisha, is an
        exciting opportunity for PhD students to come together and explore the latest developments in Machine Learning.
        The event, taking place from June 12th to June 17th, 2023, will feature presentations from selected PhD students
        who will share their insights on recent papers from top conferences such as AAAI 2023, CVPR 2023, ICLR 2023,
        ICML 2022, KDD 2022, NeurIPS 2022, and SIGGRAPH 2022. The students will have the chance to suggest three papers
        of their choice while applying, but may also be requested to present alternate papers. The event aims to foster
        learning, discussion, and collaboration among PhD students, providing them with a platform to showcase their
        research and engage in meaningful discussions with fellow peers. Participants will also be provided with
        accommodation, food, and travel expenses, ensuring a conducive environment for intellectual exchange and
        networking. The PhD Pathana Gosthi website will serve as a hub for information and updates about the event, as
